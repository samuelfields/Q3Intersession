Game Spotlight

		<h3>
Enter The Gungeon
		</h3>
		<p>
			Available on Xbox, Steam, GOG, Humble Store, PS4, and Switch. It is a retro style top down shooter game so if that does not strike your fancy then move on to the next game. The game has a slow progression in terms of unlocking items but has a rewarding system that makes it worth it. You start the game with four characters, each with their own unique starting equipment and weapons, but 2 more can be unlocked as you get better and eventually beat the game. The game has a VERY LARGE amount of different items, 190 guns and 200 items to be precise which you either start out with or can unlock with the games permanent currency (Hegemony Credits.) Overall fun gameplay and difficult boss fights. Enter The Gungeon is not to be taken to be played lightly, this game can be very difficult and rage-inducing at times.

The Rising of the Shield Hero
		</h3>
		<p>
			"Naofumi Iwatani was summoned into a parallel world along with three other people to become the world's Heroes. Each of the heroes were respectively equipped with their own legendary equipment when summoned. Naofumi happened to receive the Legendary Shield, the sole defensive equipment, while the others received weapons capable of attacking. Unlike the other heroes who are fully supported by the kingdom and gain several strong allies each, Naofumi's luck turns to the worse after his single companion, later revealed to be none other than Princess Malty, betrays him, and leaves him devoid of all assistance and supplies after she falsely accuses him of sexually assaulting her."

			The Rising of the Shield Hero is an isekai adventure including lots of suffering, but not as much as Re:Zero, which is a manga that now has an adaptation (happiness noises!!!) it has a great story and many cute waifus that makes you just want to give pats.

			Solo Leveling
		</h3>
		<p>
			"10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as "Hunters". However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I'm someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the "World's Weakest". Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!"

			-The author, Jang Sung-Lak
		</p>
		<p>
			Solo Leveling is a story that takes place in an alternate world in which "Gates"
appeared and sent catastrophy with monsters. I would add some more but Jang Sung summed it up pretty well in his description.
